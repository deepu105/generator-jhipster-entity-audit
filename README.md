# Introduction

This is a [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) blueprint, that is meant to be used in a JHipster application.

You can choose to enable audit for all entities or choose the entities to be audited from a list during generation.

The blueprint will extend the selected entities with `AbstractAuditingEntity` to enable audits, hence make sure that your entities doesn't have any super class.

This will also add new columns to the entities, so it is ideal to recreate the tables if you are enabling this for existing entities or use incremental changelog.

The Audit log page is optional and can be added by choosing the option while running the generator.

### Javers integration

When using sql or mongodb you can use [Javers](http://javers.org/) for entity auditing.

The blueprint will add [spring-boot integration for javers](http://javers.org/documentation/spring-boot-integration/). Each repository is annotated with the required `@JaversSpringDataAuditable` annotation. The new class `JaversAuthorProvider` provides javers with the correct user modifying an entity.
